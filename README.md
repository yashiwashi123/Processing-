# Processing / Programming Nature #
This repository contains material for my Programming Nature class. I learned how to 
model physical systems, produce lab reports, and create GUI's. 

My final project can be played with [here](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/492311). It is a Lazy River simulator.
